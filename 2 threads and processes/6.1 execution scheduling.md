# Scheduler
- OS function that assigns processes and threads to run
  on available CPUs
- Allows multiple programs to run concurrently on a single processor

# Recipe
- A process is created and ready to run
- The process is loaded into memory and placed in the **ready queue**
- The scheduler take processes from the **ready queue**
  and assigns them a **processor** to run

  ### Possibilities:
  - The process will run until it finishes and another process it's assigned to that processor
  - If a process get blocked and have to wait for an I/O event,
    **it will go into a separate I/O queue**, so another process can run.
  - If the scheduler determines a process has spent its fair share of time on the processor,
    it is swapped out for another process from the **ready queue**.
    When this happens, occurs a **context switch** and the scheduler must:
    - Store the state of a process or thread to resume later.
    - Load the saved state for the new process or thread to run.

# OS goals
- maximize throughput
- maximize fairness
- minimize wait time
- minimize latency

# Scheduling algorithms depending on OS goals
- first come, first served
- shortest job next
- priority
- shortest remaining time
- round robin
- multiple-level queues
