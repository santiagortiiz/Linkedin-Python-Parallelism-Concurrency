# Flynn's Taxonomy
One of the most widely used system for classify multiprocessor architectures
classification criteria: data streams and instructions streams (concurrent instructions)

- SISD: Single Instruction Single Data
- SIMD: Single Instruction Multiple Data
- MISD: Multiple Instruction Single Data
- MIMD: Multiple Instruction Multiple Data

# PArallel Programming Model
- SPMD: Single Program, Multiple Data
    The same program (not neccessarily the same instruction)
    is running in multiple cores to process multiple data
- MPMD: Multiple Program, Multiple Data
